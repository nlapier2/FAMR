\title{Get correlations between CS, using variable with maximum PIP from each CS}
\usage{
get_cs_correlation(res, X = NULL, Xcorr = NULL, max = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n by p matrix of values of the p variables (covariates) in
n samples. When provided, correlation between variables will be
computed and used to remove CSs whose minimum correlation among
variables is smaller than \code{min_abs_corr}.}

\item{Xcorr}{p by p matrix of correlations between variables
(covariates). When provided, it will be used to remove CSs whose
minimum correlation among variables is smaller than
\code{min_abs_corr}.}
