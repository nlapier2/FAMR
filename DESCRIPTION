Description: 
    This package implements the FAMR-Susie method described in the manuscript
    "Factor-based methods for robust high-dimensional Mendelian randomization".
    Factor-Augmented Mendelian Randomization (FAMR) is a general framework
    described in the manuscript, and FAMR-Susie is a specific method, but the 
    package is simply called "FAMR" for simplicity.
    FAMR-Susie is intended for use in "high-dimensional" MR, where there are
    many genetically-correlated exposures, and simultaneously learns which of 
    these exposures have a causal effect on the "outcome" trait.
    FAMR-Susie uses factor analysis to infer and correct for unobserved
    confounders, and uses sparse polygenic modeling and Bayesian regression to
    alleviate other challenges such as other violations of MR assumptions and
    sparsity.
